this ahk script will type characters using both latex and unicode codes
(in the form \something)

The site that I scraped the data from no longer exists,
but the info exists in a state before clean-up in the symbolparser.txt file.

some characters have latex codes that use curly braces. don't use those.
ex: to type ℕ do \mathbbN, whereas in latex it would be \mathbb{N}.

there are better and cleaner ways to do this that you can find.
this one probably has more symbols.
