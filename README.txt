this ahk script will type characters using both latex and unicode codes
(in the form \something)

this uses data from (this site) [https://milde.users.sourceforge.net/LUCR/Math/unimathsymbols.html]

some characters have latex codes that use curly braces. don't use those
ex: to type â„• do \mathbbN, whereas in latex it would be \mathbb{N}

there are better and cleaner ways to do this that you can find.
this one probably has more symbols.
